             Release Notes for RApiPlus.cpp version 9.3.0.0
             ----------------------------------------------

This release marks a change in policy regarding callback functions.  Previously
callbacks were abstract, and had to be implemented by the user.  Now all 
callbacks are virtual and have default implementations.  This new approach is 
less onerous, especially when upgrading versions.

This release also fixes a compatibility issue where minute bars were not 
handled as expected.

This version uses OmneFoundationLib 18.6.0.0, OmneFrameworkLib 18.3.0.0, 
OmneEngine.cpp 18.2.0.0, OmneChannel.cpp 18.2.0.0, OmneStreamEngine.cpp 
18.2.0.0, OpenSSL 1.0.2d, zlib 1.2.5, and RithmicClientCerts 6.1.0.0.

This package has been built on the following platforms :

	win7                    (Windows 7 32-bit, 64-bit) 


             Release Notes for RApiPlus.cpp version 9.2.0.0
             ----------------------------------------------

A new subscription flag which represents the lowest ask/highest bid of a
trading session has been added.  Two new classes, HighBidPriceInfo and 
LowAskPriceInfo, have been added, along with two new virtual (not abstract) 
callback routines, RCallbacks::HighBid() and RCallbacks::LowAsk().

The MarketModeInfo class has two new fields, sReason and sEvent, providing more
information regarding why the market mode has changed.

The ability to link existing orders into an OCA group has been added.

Search functionality has been enhanced to allow users to have more control 
when searching for instruments.  Users can now specify whether searches are
case sensistive, which fields to search, and the comparison operator used
when matching the search string.

This version uses OmneFoundationLib 18.6.0.0, OmneFrameworkLib 18.3.0.0, 
OmneEngine.cpp 18.2.0.0, OmneChannel.cpp 18.2.0.0, OmneStreamEngine.cpp

	win7                    (Windows 7 32-bit, 64-bit) 


             Release Notes for RApiPlus.cpp version 9.1.0.0
             ----------------------------------------------

The members bFillPriceFlag, dFillPrice and iFillSize have been moved out of 
OrderBustReport, OrderFillReport and OrderTradeCorrectReport.  They have been 
moved into their base class OrderReport.  This change has been done to support
a new order report type ("pro_forma fill").  A pro_forma fill is not a fill, but
conveys a preliminary fill price and size in these moved members.  The callback
associated with the pro_forma fill is RCallbacks::OtherReport().  The value 
of OrderReport::sReportType will be "pro_forma fill".

This version uses OmneFoundationLib 18.6.0.0, OmneFrameworkLib 18.3.0.0, 
OmneEngine.cpp 18.2.0.0, OmneChannel.cpp 18.2.0.0, OmneStreamEngine.cpp

	win7                    (Windows 7 32-bit, 64-bit) 


             Release Notes for RApiPlus.cpp version 9.0.0.1
             ----------------------------------------------

RefDataInfo has a new member indicating whether an instrument is tradable or 
not.  There are cases where an instrument is synthetic, well-defined, but not
tradable.

Time bar functionality has been removed from the 'vanilla' R | API, and is now
entirely in R | API+.

BarInfo now includes settlement price, which when available, will be included
on daily bars.

The underlying libraries have been upgraded to more recent versions.

This version uses OmneFoundationLib 18.6.0.0, OmneFrameworkLib 18.3.0.0, 
OmneEngine.cpp 18.2.0.0, OmneChannel.cpp 18.2.0.0, OmneStreamEngine.cpp 
18.2.0.0, OpenSSL 1.0.2d, zlib 1.2.5, and RithmicClientCerts 6.1.0.0.

	win7                    (Windows 7 32-bit, 64-bit) 


             Release Notes for RApiPlus.cpp version 8.5.0.0
             ----------------------------------------------

Minor fixes and documentation changes have been made.  The interface remains
the same as in 8.4.0.0.

This version uses OmneFoundationLib 18.5.0.0, OmneFrameworkLib 18.2.0.0, 
OmneEngine.cpp 18.0.0.0, OmneChannel.cpp 18.0.0.0, OmneStreamEngine.cpp 
18.0.0.0, OpenSSL 1.0.1g, zlib 1.2.5, and RithmicClientCerts 6.1.0.0.

This package has been built on the following platforms :
 	darwin-10               (Darwin 10, 64-bit)
	linux-gnu-2.6.18        (RedHat Enterprise Linux 5.5, 32-bit)
	linux-gnu-2.6.18-x86_64 (RedHat Enterprise Linux 5.5, 64-bit)
	linux-gnu-2.6.32-x86_64 (RedHat Enterprise Linux 6.3, 64-bit)
	win7                    (Windows 7 32-bit, 64-bit) 


             Release Notes for RApiPlus.cpp version 8.4.0.0
             ----------------------------------------------

Support for mid price market data has been added to REngine::subscribe().  
Mid price data is calculated as the mid point between the best bid and best 
ask prices and is used when trade market data is not available.  Currently 
mid price data is available on the IEX exchange.  There is new flag, 
MD_MID_PRICE, to indicate interest in mid price data.  There are two new info 
classes, MidPriceInfo and CloseMidPriceInfo, used to convey mid price data, 
along with two new virtual (but not abstract) callbacks.  It is possible that 
support for mid price data will be removed if/when actual trade data becomes 
available.  Support for mid price data has not been added to 
REngine::subscribeByUnderlying().

NOTE : The new callbacks are not abstract, but virtual.  In other words, one 
does not need to explicitly define them to make use of this version of 
R | API.  This approach departs from prior releases where new callbacks were 
always defined as abstract, and required implementation.  If this new, softer 
approach is preferred, please let the R | API team know.

This version uses OmneFoundationLib 18.5.0.0, OmneFrameworkLib 18.2.0.0, 
OmneEngine.cpp 18.0.0.0, OmneChannel.cpp 18.0.0.0, OmneStreamEngine.cpp 
18.0.0.0, OpenSSL 1.0.1g, zlib 1.2.5, and RithmicClientCerts 6.1.0.0.

This package has been built on the following platforms :
 	darwin-10               (Darwin 10, 64-bit)
	linux-gnu-2.6.18        (RedHat Enterprise Linux 5.5, 32-bit)

	linux-gnu-2.6.32-x86_64 (RedHat Enterprise Linux 6.3, 64-bit)
	win7                    (Windows 7 32-bit, 64-bit) 


             Release Notes for RApiPlus.cpp version 8.3.0.0
             ----------------------------------------------

Support for retrieving prior trading day order history has been added.

To request the list of dates for which order history is available, one calls
REngine::listOrderHistoryDates() and implements the corresponding virtual (but
not abstract) callback RCallbacks::OrderHistoryDates().

One requests snapshots of all orders from a particular date by calling 
REngine::replayHistoricalOrders().  This routine behaves like 
REngine::replayAllOrders() and similarly, corresponds to the existing callback 
RCallbacks::OrderReplay().

Finally, one can request the order events/messages for a single order with
REngine::replaySingleHistoricalOrder().  This routine behaves like
REngine::replaySingleOrder() and will cause the normal order update callbacks 
to fire, with an additional call to RCallbacks::SingleOrderReplay() to fire 
when the callbacks are done.

This version uses OmneFoundationLib 18.5.0.0, OmneFrameworkLib 18.2.0.0, 
OmneEngine.cpp 18.0.0.0, OmneChannel.cpp 18.0.0.0, OmneStreamEngine.cpp 
18.0.0.0, OpenSSL 1.0.1g, zlib 1.2.5, and RithmicClientCerts 6.1.0.0.

This package has been built on the following platforms :
 	darwin-10               (Darwin 10, 64-bit)
	linux-gnu-2.6.18        (RedHat Enterprise Linux 5.5, 32-bit)
	linux-gnu-2.6.18-x86_64 (RedHat Enterprise Linux 5.5, 64-bit)
	linux-gnu-2.6.32-x86_64 (RedHat Enterprise Linux 6.3, 64-bit)
	win7                    (Windows 7 32-bit, 64-bit) 


             Release Notes for RApiPlus.cpp version 8.2.0.0
             ----------------------------------------------

Support for quoting has been added to 'regular' R | API.  The REngine 
methods and RCallbacks callbacks supporting quoting is modeled on the existing
interface for orders.  The previous quoting interface, which was only 
available in R | Diamond API, has changed to match the 'regular' interface.

New methods have been added to REngine : 

    REngine::cancelQuoteList()
    REngine::replayQuotes()
    REngine::submitQuoteList()

New classes have been added :

    QuoteInfo
    QuoteReport
    QuoteReplayInfo
    QuoteParams
    QuoteCancelParams

Users can receive updates on quoting activity by calling 
REngine::subscribeOrder().  However, there are new callbacks associated with 
quoting functionality :

    RCallbacks::Quote(QuoteInfo)
    RCallbacks::Quote(QuoteReport)
    RCallbacks::QuoteReplay()

NOTE : The new callbacks associated with quoting are not abstract, but 
virtual.  In other words, one does not need to explicitly define them to make 
use of this version of R | API.  This approach departs from prior releases where
new callbacks were defined as abstract, and required explicit definition from 
users of R | API.  If this new, softer approach is preferred, please let the 
R | API team know.

This version uses OmneFoundationLib 18.5.0.0, OmneFrameworkLib 18.2.0.0, 
OmneEngine.cpp 18.0.0.0, OmneChannel.cpp 18.0.0.0, OmneStreamEngine.cpp 
18.0.0.0, OpenSSL 1.0.1g, zlib 1.2.5, and RithmicClientCerts 6.1.0.0.

             Release Notes for RApiPlus.cpp version 8.1.0.0
             ----------------------------------------------

Support for mid price on best bid/best ask updates has been added.

This version uses OmneFoundationLib 18.5.0.0, OmneFrameworkLib 18.2.0.0, 
OmneEngine.cpp 18.0.0.0, OmneChannel.cpp 18.0.0.0, OmneStreamEngine.cpp 
18.0.0.0, OpenSSL 1.0.1g, zlib 1.2.5, and RithmicClientCerts 6.1.0.0.

This package has been built on the following platforms :
 	darwin-10               (Darwin 10, 64-bit)
	linux-gnu-2.6.18        (RedHat Enterprise Linux 5.5, 32-bit)

	win7                    (Windows 7 32-bit, 64-bit) 


             Release Notes for RApiPlus.cpp version 8.0.0.0
             ----------------------------------------------

The order number, which was currently of type int, has been changed to the type 
tsNCharcb.  Yes, it has finally happened.  This change affects all references
to order numbers.

It is now possible to modify sUserMsg and sUserTag, two strings associated with
an order, without modifying the order itself.  This functionality makes use of 
a special request, REngine::modifyOrderRefData(), which does not go to the 
exchange (as no exchange-related properties of the order are being modified).  
This routine is the only way to modify the value of sUserTag, which previously 
could only be set when placing the order and could not be modified thereafter.  

A source timestamp has been added to the OrderReport class.  This source 
timestamp is conveyed when the data is available, and uses the ssboe convention
but with nanoseconds as the fractional second format.

This version uses OmneFoundationLib 18.5.0.0, OmneFrameworkLib 18.2.0.0, 
OmneEngine.cpp 18.0.0.0, OmneChannel.cpp 18.0.0.0, OmneStreamEngine.cpp 
18.0.0.0, OpenSSL 1.0.1g, zlib 1.2.5, and RithmicClientCerts 6.1.0.0.

This package has been built on the following platforms :
 	darwin-10               (Darwin 10, 64-bit)
	linux-gnu-2.6.18        (RedHat Enterprise Linux 5.5, 32-bit)
	linux-gnu-2.6.18-x86_64 (RedHat Enterprise Linux 5.5, 64-bit)
	linux-gnu-2.6.32-x86_64 (RedHat Enterprise Linux 6.3, 64-bit)
	win7                    (Windows 7 32-bit, 64-bit) 


             Release Notes for RApiPlus.cpp version 7.3.0.0
             ----------------------------------------------

NOTE : In a future release, the order number, which is currently an int,
       will be changed to the type tsNCharcb.

A new callback has been added, RCallbacks::BestBidAskQuote().  When the R | API
client receives a message which includes both the best bid and ask, this 
callback will be invoked.  Previously the best ask callback was invoked first,
followed by the best bid callback.

It is possible that the best bid and ask will both change simultaneously on a 
single market event.  In this case, the new callback will more accurately 
reflect market conditions.

It is also possible that a market data feed will always publish both the best 
bid and ask even when only one side has updated.  In this case, the new callback
will avoid what would appear as duplicate best bid/ask updates.

The existing RCallbacks::BestBidQuote() and RCallbacks::BestAskQuote()
callbacks will continue to be invoked if only one side of the best bid/ask is
received by the R | API client.

To port prior versions of R | API to this version without changing any best
bid/ask logic, one can invoke the best ask and then best bid callbacks from 
within the new  best bid/ask callback.

This version uses OmneFoundationLib 18.5.0.0, OmneFrameworkLib 18.2.0.0, 
OmneEngine.cpp 18.0.0.0, OmneChannel.cpp 18.0.0.0, OmneStreamEngine.cpp

             Release Notes for RApiPlus.cpp version 6.7.0.0
             ----------------------------------------------

NOTE : In a future release, the order number, which is currently an int,
       will be changed to the type tsNCharcb.

A new parameter has been added to all order operations (new, modify and 
cancel).  This parameter flags the order operation with an algorithm string.
Some exchanges may require this parameter to be set and have guidelines 
regarding the value.  The following classes/methods have been affected :

     - OrderParams
     - LimitOrderParams
     - MarketOrderParams
     - ModifyOrderParams
     - ModifyLimitOrderParams
     - ModifyStopLimitOrderParams
     - ModifyStopMarketOrderParams
     - REngine::cancelAllOrders()
     - REngine::cancelOrder()
     - REngine::cancelOrderList()
     - LineInfo

Various enhancements and bug fixes have been made.  A race condition where 
the order context may inadvertantly be blank has been solved.  The 
OpeningIndicator class now has a volume, to go with a price.  The order 
release connection id has been removed from the header file as it is no
longer used.

The REngine::replayBars() method will now 'align' the start/end ssboe values
when requesting minute bars.  Previously an unaligned value would result in
the infrastructure returning a 'bad input' error.  In addition, the 
ReplayBarParams class has been documented.

             Release Notes for RApiPlus.cpp version 6.5.0.0
             ----------------------------------------------

The ability to specify a user tag when placing an order has been added 
(OrderParams::sUserTag).  The user tag is different from the existing order 
tag (OrderParams::sTag) in that it is intended to be reserved for end users' 
use.  The existing order tag is often used by trading applications and 
consequently unavailable to end users.

Replaying a single order has been added.  The replay functionality applies to
orders from the current trading session.  To support this functionality, a
new callback type field (iType) has been added to the LineInfo and OrderReport 
classes.  The value of iType can be examined to determine if the LineInfo or
OrderReport are from the real time stream, cache, or historical database. The 
field bPossOutOfOrder has been removed from both classes, as it
can be represented within the iType model as MD_IMAGE_CB.

The ability to search for instruments has been added.  The search can be done
within an exchange using case insensitive substring matches of search terms 
to key fields in the instrument database.

The buy and sell components of a net position have been added to PnlInfo.

Minor fixes and enhancements have beem made, including updated documentation 
supporting the changes to OrderParams, LineInfo and OrderReport.

This is the first release of R | API+.  R | API+ provides the same 
functionality as R | API of the same version, along with additional 
capabilities.

This version adds functionality for tick, volume, range, minute and daily bars.

One can subsribe to, unsubscribe from, and request historical bars using :
    REngine::subscribeBar(),
    REngine::unsubscribeBar(), and
    REngine::replayBars().

There are two new callbacks :
    RCallbacks::Bar() and
    RCallbacks::BarReplay().

Bar data is conveyed using the BarInfo class and BarReplayInfo class.
