             Release Notes for RApi.cpp version 8.5.0.0
             ------------------------------------------

Minor fixes and documentation changes have been made.  The interface remains
the same as in 8.4.0.0.

This version uses OmneFoundationLib 18.5.0.0, OmneFrameworkLib 18.2.0.0, 
OmneEngine.cpp 18.0.0.0, OmneChannel.cpp 18.0.0.0, OmneStreamEngine.cpp 
18.0.0.0, OpenSSL 1.0.1g, zlib 1.2.5, and RithmicClientCerts 6.1.0.0.

This package has been built on the following platforms :
 	darwin-10               (Darwin 10, 64-bit)
	linux-gnu-2.6.18        (RedHat Enterprise Linux 5.5, 32-bit)
	linux-gnu-2.6.18-x86_64 (RedHat Enterprise Linux 5.5, 64-bit)
	linux-gnu-2.6.32-x86_64 (RedHat Enterprise Linux 6.3, 64-bit)
	win7                    (Windows 7 32-bit, 64-bit) 


             Release Notes for RApi.cpp version 8.4.0.0
             ------------------------------------------

Support for mid price market data has been added to REngine::subscribe().  
Mid price data is calculated as the mid point between the best bid and best 
ask prices and is used when trade market data is not available.  Currently 
mid price data is available on the IEX exchange.  There is new flag, 
MD_MID_PRICE, to indicate interest in mid price data.  There are two new info 
classes, MidPriceInfo and CloseMidPriceInfo, used to convey mid price data, 
along with two new virtual (but not abstract) callbacks.  It is possible that 
support for mid price data will be removed if/when actual trade data becomes 
available.  Support for mid price data has not been added to 
REngine::subscribeByUnderlying().

NOTE : The new callbacks are not abstract, but virtual.  In other words, one 
does not need to explicitly define them to make use of this version of 
R | API.  This approach departs from prior releases where new callbacks were 
always defined as abstract, and required implementation.  If this new, softer 
approach is preferred, please let the R | API team know.

This version uses OmneFoundationLib 18.5.0.0, OmneFrameworkLib 18.2.0.0, 
OmneEngine.cpp 18.0.0.0, OmneChannel.cpp 18.0.0.0, OmneStreamEngine.cpp 
18.0.0.0, OpenSSL 1.0.1g, zlib 1.2.5, and RithmicClientCerts 6.1.0.0.

This package has been built on the following platforms :
 	darwin-10               (Darwin 10, 64-bit)
	linux-gnu-2.6.18        (RedHat Enterprise Linux 5.5, 32-bit)
	linux-gnu-2.6.18-x86_64 (RedHat Enterprise Linux 5.5, 64-bit)
	linux-gnu-2.6.32-x86_64 (RedHat Enterprise Linux 6.3, 64-bit)
	win7                    (Windows 7 32-bit, 64-bit) 


             Release Notes for RApi.cpp version 8.3.0.0
             ------------------------------------------

Support for retrieving prior trading day order history has been added.

To request the list of dates for which order history is available, one calls
REngine::listOrderHistoryDates() and implements the corresponding virtual (but
not abstract) callback RCallbacks::OrderHistoryDates().

One requests snapshots of all orders from a particular date by calling 
REngine::replayHistoricalOrders().  This routine behaves like 
REngine::replayAllOrders() and similarly, corresponds to the existing callback 
RCallbacks::OrderReplay().

Finally, one can request the order events/messages for a single order with
REngine::replaySingleHistoricalOrder().  This routine behaves like
REngine::replaySingleOrder() and will cause the normal order update callbacks 
to fire, with an additional call to RCallbacks::SingleOrderReplay() to fire 
when the callbacks are done.

This version uses OmneFoundationLib 18.5.0.0, OmneFrameworkLib 18.2.0.0, 
OmneEngine.cpp 18.0.0.0, OmneChannel.cpp 18.0.0.0, OmneStreamEngine.cpp 
18.0.0.0, OpenSSL 1.0.1g, zlib 1.2.5, and RithmicClientCerts 6.1.0.0.

This package has been built on the following platforms :
 	darwin-10               (Darwin 10, 64-bit)
	linux-gnu-2.6.18        (RedHat Enterprise Linux 5.5, 32-bit)
	linux-gnu-2.6.18-x86_64 (RedHat Enterprise Linux 5.5, 64-bit)
	linux-gnu-2.6.32-x86_64 (RedHat Enterprise Linux 6.3, 64-bit)
	win7                    (Windows 7 32-bit, 64-bit) 


             Release Notes for RApi.cpp version 8.2.0.0
             ------------------------------------------

Support for quoting has been added to 'regular' R | API.  The REngine 
methods and RCallbacks callbacks supporting quoting is modeled on the existing
interface for orders.  The previous quoting interface, which was only 
available in R | Diamond API, has changed to match the 'regular' interface.

New methods have been added to REngine : 

    REngine::cancelQuoteList()
    REngine::replayQuotes()
    REngine::submitQuoteList()

New classes have been added :

    QuoteInfo
    QuoteReport
    QuoteReplayInfo
    QuoteParams
    QuoteCancelParams

Users can receive updates on quoting activity by calling 
REngine::subscribeOrder().  However, there are new callbacks associated with 
quoting functionality :

    RCallbacks::Quote(QuoteInfo)
    RCallbacks::Quote(QuoteReport)
    RCallbacks::QuoteReplay()

NOTE : The new callbacks associated with quoting are not abstract, but 
virtual.  In other words, one does not need to explicitly define them to make 
use of this version of R | API.  This approach departs from prior releases where
new callbacks were defined as abstract, and required explicit definition from 
users of R | API.  If this new, softer approach is preferred, please let the 
R | API team know.

This version uses OmneFoundationLib 18.5.0.0, OmneFrameworkLib 18.2.0.0, 
OmneEngine.cpp 18.0.0.0, OmneChannel.cpp 18.0.0.0, OmneStreamEngine.cpp 
18.0.0.0, OpenSSL 1.0.1g, zlib 1.2.5, and RithmicClientCerts 6.1.0.0.

This package has been built on the following platforms :
 	darwin-10               (Darwin 10, 64-bit)
	linux-gnu-2.6.18        (RedHat Enterprise Linux 5.5, 32-bit)

	win7                    (Windows 7 32-bit, 64-bit) 


             Release Notes for RApi.cpp version 8.1.0.0
             ------------------------------------------

Support for mid price on best bid/best ask updates has been added.

This version uses OmneFoundationLib 18.5.0.0, OmneFrameworkLib 18.2.0.0, 
OmneEngine.cpp 18.0.0.0, OmneChannel.cpp 18.0.0.0, OmneStreamEngine.cpp 
18.0.0.0, OpenSSL 1.0.1g, zlib 1.2.5, and RithmicClientCerts 6.1.0.0.

This package has been built on the following platforms :
 	darwin-10               (Darwin 10, 64-bit)
	linux-gnu-2.6.18        (RedHat Enterprise Linux 5.5, 32-bit)
	linux-gnu-2.6.18-x86_64 (RedHat Enterprise Linux 5.5, 64-bit)
	linux-gnu-2.6.32-x86_64 (RedHat Enterprise Linux 6.3, 64-bit)
	win7                    (Windows 7 32-bit, 64-bit) 


             Release Notes for RApi.cpp version 8.0.0.0
             ------------------------------------------

The order number, which was currently of type int, has been changed to the type 
tsNCharcb.  Yes, it has finally happened.  This change affects all references
to order numbers.

It is now possible to modify sUserMsg and sUserTag, two strings associated with
an order, without modifying the order itself.  This functionality makes use of 
a special request, REngine::modifyOrderRefData(), which does not go to the 
exchange (as no exchange-related properties of the order are being modified).  
This routine is the only way to modify the value of sUserTag, which previously 
could only be set when placing the order and could not be modified thereafter.  

A source timestamp has been added to the OrderReport class.  This source 
timestamp is conveyed when the data is available, and uses the ssboe convention
but with nanoseconds as the fractional second format.

This version uses OmneFoundationLib 18.5.0.0, OmneFrameworkLib 18.2.0.0, 
OmneEngine.cpp 18.0.0.0, OmneChannel.cpp 18.0.0.0, OmneStreamEngine.cpp 
18.0.0.0, OpenSSL 1.0.1g, zlib 1.2.5, and RithmicClientCerts 6.1.0.0.

This package has been built on the following platforms :
 	darwin-10               (Darwin 10, 64-bit)
	linux-gnu-2.6.18        (RedHat Enterprise Linux 5.5, 32-bit)
	linux-gnu-2.6.18-x86_64 (RedHat Enterprise Linux 5.5, 64-bit)
	linux-gnu-2.6.32-x86_64 (RedHat Enterprise Linux 6.3, 64-bit)
	win7                    (Windows 7 32-bit, 64-bit) 


             Release Notes for RApi.cpp version 7.3.0.0
             ------------------------------------------

NOTE : In a future release, the order number, which is currently an int,
       will be changed to the type tsNCharcb.

A new callback has been added, RCallbacks::BestBidAskQuote().  When the R | API
client receives a message which includes both the best bid and ask, this 
callback will be invoked.  Previously the best ask callback was invoked first,
followed by the best bid callback.

It is possible that the best bid and ask will both change simultaneously on a 
single market event.  In this case, the new callback will more accurately 
reflect market conditions.

It is also possible that a market data feed will always publish both the best 
bid and ask even when only one side has updated.  In this case, the new callback
will avoid what would appear as duplicate best bid/ask updates.

The existing RCallbacks::BestBidQuote() and RCallbacks::BestAskQuote()
callbacks will continue to be invoked if only one side of the best bid/ask is
received by the R | API client.

To port prior versions of R | API to this version without changing any best
bid/ask logic, one can invoke the best ask and then best bid callbacks from 
within the new  best bid/ask callback.

This version uses OmneFoundationLib 18.5.0.0, OmneFrameworkLib 18.2.0.0, 
OmneEngine.cpp 18.0.0.0, OmneChannel.cpp 18.0.0.0, OmneStreamEngine.cpp

             ------------------------------------------

NOTE : In a future release, the order number, which is currently an int,
       will be changed to the type tsNCharcb.

A new parameter has been added to all order operations (new, modify and 
cancel).  This parameter flags the order operation with an algorithm string.

             Release Notes for RApi.cpp version 6.5.0.0
             ------------------------------------------

The ability to specify a user tag when placing an order has been added 
(OrderParams::sUserTag).  The user tag is different from the existing order 
tag (OrderParams::sTag) in that it is intended to be reserved for end users' 
use.  The existing order tag is often used by trading applications and 
consequently unavailable to end users.

Replaying a single order has been added.  The replay functionality applies to
orders from the current trading session.  To support this functionality, a
new callback type field (iType) has been added to the LineInfo and OrderReport 
classes.  The value of iType can be examined to determine if the LineInfo or
OrderReport are from the real time stream, cache, or historical database. The 
field bPossOutOfOrder has been removed from both classes, as it
can be represented within the iType model as MD_IMAGE_CB.

The buy and sell components of a net position have been added to PnlInfo.

Minor fixes and enhancements have beem made, including updated documentation 
supporting the changes to OrderParams, LineInfo and OrderReport.

             Release Notes for RApi.cpp version 6.0.0.0
             ------------------------------------------

Support for binary contracts has been added.  Users can retrieve binary 
contract security definitions using REngine::getBinaryContractList() and 
subscribe to binary contract definitions as they are published using 
REngine::subscribeByUnderlying().  Users can subscribe to binary contract 
market data using REngine::subscribe().

New fields have been added to RefDataInfo to support binary contracts, and
a new subscription flag, MD_REF_DATA, has been added to support subscribing for
reference data.  The ref data flag parameter has been removed from 
REngine::subscribeByUnderlying(), as it is no longer necessary with 
MD_REF_DATA.

New SSL certificate files are included with this release, as the old 
certificate files expire on 08-July-2013.  These new certificates expire on
03-May-2014.

A compatibility fix has been made for Windows XP.  If XP libraries are used
to build applications for both Windows XP and Windows 7, the environment must
contain "RAPI_SYNC_TIMEOUT=disable" to avoid an error in the REngine 
constructor.  This approach is discouraged, as disabing the sync timeout 
mechanism reduces network robustness.

This version uses OmneFoundationLib 17.18.1.0, OmneFrameworkLib 17.18.1.0,

             Release Notes for RApi.cpp version 5.7.0.0
             ------------------------------------------

This version introduces the ability to subscribe to market data by an 
underlying instrument (REngine::subscribeByUnderlying() and 
REngine::unsubscribeByUnderlying()).  It can be used to simplify subscriptions 
for market data by option chain.  The scope of the market data is specified by 
the underlying instrument, the exchange, and an expiration.  The subscription 
flag convention is the same as normal subscriptions.

NOTE : 
A staged migration is underway where the instrument type value "Spread" will 
now have different values to more accurately distinguish what kind of Spread 
it is.

Below are the values :

1. Future Strategy        (The legs are futures.)
2. Equity Option Strategy (The legs are equity options.)
3. Future Option Strategy (The legs are options on futures.)
4. Equity Hybrid Strategy (The legs are an equity and its option.)
5. Future Hybrid Strategy (The legs are a future and its option.)

This value appears in RefDataInfo::sInstrumentType.

if the failed operation was a new order, cancellation or modification.  The
values usedin these cases are :
     complete            (sLINE_STATUS_COMPLETE)
     Cancellation Failed (sLINE_STATUS_CANCEL_FAILED)
     Modification Failed (sLINE_STATUS_MODIFY_FAILED)

TradeInfo now includes timestamp values as presented by the exchange, if 
available.

             Release Notes for RApi.cpp version 5.3.1.0
             ------------------------------------------

Although the interface remains unchanged from 5.3.0.0, minor changes and fixes 
have been made, including adding back some missing documentation, and removing 
a hostname resolution condition which caused the REngine constructor to fail.

This version uses OmneFoundationLib 17.9.2.0, OmneFrameworkLib 17.6.0.0, 
OmneEngine.cpp 17.8.0.0, OmneChannel.cpp 17.6.0.0, OmneStreamEngine.cpp

             Release Notes for RApi.cpp version 5.3.0.0
             ------------------------------------------

Profit and Loss (PnL) information is now retrieved from the 'PnL tree', which
will appear as a new connect point.  Previously PnL information was retrieved 
from the order plant (trading system connect point).  The following reflects
this change : 

     - LoginParams::sPnlCnnctPt has been added
     - REngine::replayPnl() requires a connection to the PnL tree
     - REngine::subscribeAccount(), which used to subcribe to order and PnL
       updates, has been removed
     - REngine::subscribePnl() has been added for PnL updates
     - REngine::subscribeOrder() has been added for order updates

The callback conventions remain the same - PnL updates resulting from PnL 
subscriptions will be invoked on RCallbacks::PnlUpdate(), and order updates
will be invoked on OrderReport callbacks or LineUpdate.

Previously, PnL updates were published by the order plant during periods of
order activity.  The PnL tree also publishes PnL information periodically, 
typically once per second, for Accounts with trading activity in the current
session and for instruments with open positions.

             Release Notes for RApi.cpp version 5.2.0.0
             ------------------------------------------

The ability to specify a new max show quantity has been removed from 
ModifyOrderParams, as the value cannot be modified for an existing order.

This release reorganizes the documentation, and removes the PDF version of the
Programmers' Guide, which has been subsumed into the html.  A Quick Start 
document has been added.

The sample code now has either a compile line in the source code comments for
non-Windows platforms, and a Visual Studio 2010 project for Windows platforms.

This version uses OmneFoundationLib 17.9.1.0, OmneFrameworkLib 17.6.0.0, 
OmneEngine.cpp 17.8.0.0, OmneChannel.cpp 17.6.0.0, OmneStreamEngine.cpp

             Release Notes for RApi.cpp version 5.1.0.0
             ------------------------------------------

This release modifies third party indicator functionality.  The ability to 
retrieve a list of indicator sources from the order plant has been removed,
along with associated classes and methods.  The ability to retrieve a list of 
indicators has been updated.

This version uses OmneFoundationLib 17.9.0.0, OmneFrameworkLib 17.6.0.0, 
OmneEngine.cpp 17.8.0.0, OmneChannel.cpp 17.6.0.0, OmneStreamEngine.cpp 
17.7.0.0, OpenSSL 0.9.8l, and zlib 1.2.5.

This package has been built on the following platforms :
	linux-gnu-2.6        (RedHat Enterprise Linux 5.4, 32-bit)
	linux-gnu-2.6-x86_64 (RedHat Enterprise Linux 5.5, 64-bit)
 	darwin-10            (Darwin 10, 64-bit)
	win7                 (Windows 7 32-bit, 64-bit) 


             Release Notes for RApi.cpp version 5.0.0.0
             ------------------------------------------

This release adds functionality supporting third party indicator data.  The
functionality includes :

     - logging in and out
     - querying for the available list of indicators
     - requesting historical indicator data
     - requesting real-time indicator data

The new class RIndicatorConn represents the connection to access indicator 
data.  Using this class, one connects to an indicator plant and can request 
indicator data.  There is a corresponding (pure abstract) class 
RIndicatorCallbacks which defines all the callback methods.  For each callback 
method there is a new Info class conveying data pertinent to the callback.

The relationship between RIndicatorConn and RIndicatorCallbacks is similar to 
the one between REngine and RCallbacks in that actions are initiated by 
RIndicatorConn and the results are conveyed through RIndicatorCallbacks.

Logging into the indicator plant (RIndicatorConn::login()) does not depend on 
logging into the standard Rithmic trading platform (REngine::login()).

It is possible to retrieve a list of sources from the standard Rithmic trading 
platform by calling REngine::listIndicatorSources().

This version uses OmneFoundationLib 17.9.0.0, OmneFrameworkLib 17.6.0.0, 
OmneEngine.cpp 17.8.0.0, OmneChannel.cpp 17.6.0.0, OmneStreamEngine.cpp 
17.7.0.0, OpenSSL 0.9.8l, and zlib 1.2.5.
